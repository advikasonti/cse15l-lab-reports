### 2. Remotely Connecting

Before you begin to remotely connect, make sure to change your course-specific account password at https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php. Open your terminal and run the command `$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with the `zz` replaced with your personal course account letters. It'll then ask you to input your password. After the login succeeds, you should see messages like this:
