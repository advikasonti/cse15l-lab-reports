# Lab Report 1

##  Remote Access

### 1. Installing VScode

Follow the installation instructions specific to your computer using the Visual Studio Code 
[website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It will outline options for Macs and PCs so download the zip for the correct version. Open that up to install the application, which you can then categorize with the rest of you applications.
Once installed, the opened application interface should look like this:

### 2. Remotely Connecting

Before you begin to remotely connect, make sure to change your course-specific account password at https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php. Open your terminal and run the command `$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with the `zz` replaced with your personal course account letters. It'll then ask you to input your password. After the login succeeds, you should see messages like this:

### 3. Trying Some Commands

Run different combinations of the following commands:
```
cd
ls
pwd
mkdir
cp
```
You will get varying result messages depending on how you choose to play around with these funtions, but here is an example of some statements you may receive. From running these commands in various orders, I learned that the output can cary depending on what come prior or latter. For instance, the `cd` command stands for change directory, so it can help you get to the directory you are looking for. Another example is the `ls` which will list the files under that directory. There are many other commands and combinations that you can take a look at as well.
