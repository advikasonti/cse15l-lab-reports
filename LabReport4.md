### 1. Log into ieng6
To do this step, I just typed ssh, then found the exact ieng6 server username, and copy and pasted it using `<Cmd+C>` and `<Cmd+V`.

### 2. Clone fork of repo
Here, I simply typed git clone and then copy pasted the ssh using `<Cmd+C>` and `<Cmd+V`. Since I already cloned the repo during the lab time, the command prompt simply tells me that I have already done so in the screenshot below.

### 4. Fix the code
I then typed `nano ListExamples.java` to edit the code. I fixed the code by changing `index1` to `index2` in the 43rd line, and saved it with `<Cmd+X>` and `Y` to save upon request.
